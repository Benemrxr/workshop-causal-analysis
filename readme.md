# Workshop in Causal Analysis (FS22)

This GitHub repository is home to our assignment code for the spring term [Workshop in Causal Analysis](https://portal.unilu.ch/details?code=FS221501) at the University of Lucerne. We replicate an old shift-share instrumental variables [study](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20181047) with the new [Bartik](https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20180010) instrument approach.
