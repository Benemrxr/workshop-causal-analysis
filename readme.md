# Workshop in Causal Analysis (FS22)

This GitHub repository is home to our assignment source code for the spring term [Workshop in Causal Analysis](https://portal.unilu.ch/details?code=FS221501) at the University of Lucerne. We replicate an old shift-share instrumental variables [study](https://https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20181047) with the new [Bartik](https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20180010) instrument approach.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. Explicitly describe the two papers at hand, explaining the old vs. new approach and shortly depict the data set for our replication.
